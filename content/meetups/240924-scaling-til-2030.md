Epoch AI recently released a report estimating the amount AI training runs will continue to scale up by 2030. They could get big, and expensive, and deliver a lot in terms of increased capabilities.

Luke Frymire from Epoch will walk us through the report and explain where the key bottlenecks will be in AI scaling over the next few years.

We welcome a variety of backgrounds, opinions and experience levels.
