Getting here: Enter the lobby at 100 University Ave (right next to St Andrew subway station), and message Giles Edkins on the meetup app or call him on 647-823-4865 to be let up to room 6H.

Some of you want to help out, and that's great! Giles will guide through some of the best resources available today for those of us wanting to address the most severe harms from AI. The focus will be on how to get doing cool stuff quickly, and how to stay networked with the community.

We welcome a variety of backgrounds, opinions and experience levels.
