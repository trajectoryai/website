Getting here: Enter the lobby at 100 University Ave (right next to St Andrew subway station), and message Giles Edkins on the meetup app or call him on 647-823-4865 to be let up to room 6H.

What are the different frontier AI labs' attitudes towards safety? What kinds of safety agenda (if any) are they prioritizing? Annie will guide us.

We welcome a variety of backgrounds, opinions and experience levels.
